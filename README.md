<i>DBS Building Services Website - Version 3.0</i>

https://kieransavory.github.io/DBSV3/

<h1>The Brief</h1>

Build a single page static site allowing potential customers to easily view projects created by DBS Building Services. Ease of use and fast load times 
are essential as clientelle are sometimes older and potentially less technologically apt. Must be fully responsive on a range of devices given 
aforementioned reasons. 

<h2>What I've learned during this project</h2> 

- Creation of contact form using PHP as back end language. </br> 
- Further experience and increased knowledge around client side contact form validation and string manipulation for purposes of client safety. </br>
- Testing user input dynamically with onkeyup functions. </br>
- Basic server side rendering to check if input fields are empty. </br>
- Storing image url's inside of an array and utilising a variable with an incrementation function to create an image carousel with minimal HTML.
